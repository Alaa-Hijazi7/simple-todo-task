Hi Alaa,

Thanks for your interest in the Frontend Engineer role and for the great conversation we had. As a next step, we'd like you to complete a take-home assignment. It’s a chance for you to show off your skills.

The goal is to build a simple web application for task management. We're looking for clean, well-structured code that follows modern best practices.

Project Requirements:

Your app should be a complete, frontend-only application. Please make sure it includes the following:

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for all styling and UI parts. The design should be polished and look exactly as the Figma file (make it pixel-perfect).
Responsiveness: The app must work perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Theming: Add a light and a dark theme, allowing the user to switch between them.
Localization: The app should support English (en) and Arabic (ar) using i18next. It also needs to correctly handle Left-to-Right (LTR) and Right-to-Right (RTL) text direction.
Local Storage: All app data, including user info and tasks, should be stored using localStorage.
Functionality:
*User Management: Build a simple Sign Up and Sign In process.
*Tasks & Statuses: Users should be able to create new tasks and define different statuses for them.
\*Data Display: Show all created tasks in a well-organized table.
UI Features: The task table must have pagination to handle a large number of tasks.
Code Structure: The project should be well structured, and it should also use TypeScript.
Please ensure the final design is pixel-perfect and follows the Figma file attached later. For any missing elements, such as loading states, please use your best judgment to design a solution that fits the overall style and user experience.

If you find yourself unable to complete every requirement, please prioritize quality over quantity. We would be far more impressed by a smaller, polished, and fully functional part of the application than a rushed attempt to implement all features. In that case, simply add a note to your submission outlining what you chose to focus on and why.

Deadline: Please submit your solution by Sunday, September 14, 2025

If you have any questions, just let us know.

We’re looking forward to seeing your work.
